# Giphy API

generates a Giphy API call for a set number of images based on pre-configured buttons. Has an input field where users can create new buttons and then have the Giphy API do an AJAX call for the newly added buttons.  Images will animate when they are clicked and go back to stills when clicked again.

## Getting Started

Click a button on the sidebar to generate images. Then click the images to toggle between animated and still.
